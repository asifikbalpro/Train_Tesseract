1. To train a new font take or create a image file where all the text
    charecter's are there.

2. download jTessBoxEditor.
3. open jTessBoxEditor:
    * Tools->marge tiff-select file -> output file ->[train.my.exp0]

4. from project directory:
    Run command:
    	this makes the box file. box contain the tif files cordinate, size and charecters
        *tesseract train.my.exp0.tif train.my.exp0 batch.nochop makebox

5. open jTessBoxEditor:
	from this you edit the box file.
    * Box editor -> open[train.my.exp0.tif] -> "set all the charecters how you discribe
        and adjust the boxes size" -> save.

6. from project directory:
    run command:
        *tesseract train.my.exp0.tif train.my.exp0 box.train
        	this one creates training file. 'tr'
        *unicharset_extractor train.my.exp0.box
        	this one creates unicharecter from box file.
        *echo "arial 0 0 1 0 0" > font_properties
        	this creates a font properties but i have no idea what it does.
        *mftraining -F font_properties -U unicharset -O train.unicharset train.my.exp0.tr
        	this creates  three files for the training.
        *cntraining train.my.exp0.tr
        	this creates another training file for the training

7. Rename the following files:
    *shapetable -> train.shapetable
    *inttemp ->train.inttemp
    *pffmtable ->train.pffmtable
    *normproto ->train.normproto

8. from project directory:
    run command:
        *combine_tessdata train. "make sure to put dot at last"
        	this combines all the data from all train file and creates traineddata.


this will genarate a 'train.traineddata' file.
move this file to tesseract train data folder.
done.

to check if it is working run command:
    *tesseract imagefile stdout -l train 'train is the laguage that you trained'
    
for improve this traineddata try git train_tessereact
